Observation 1:

Players of the game are mostly male. This means there is potentially opportunity to greatly expand the player base by changing marketing/game play to appeal to other genders.

Observation 2:

Male players, although they are a majority of the consumers, spend the least amount of money per player as compared to other genders. If the game play/marketing for the game was changed to attract other genders it would potentially also attract more spending.

Observation 3:

Players in the age range 30-39 spend the most per player, slightly more than players <10. 30–39-year-old players tend to have more disposable income and therefore more money to spend on in-game purchases. Players that are <10 tend to be spending their parent’s money and have less of a sense of cost. Growing these two demographics could lead to higher total in-game spending.
